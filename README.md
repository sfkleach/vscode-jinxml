> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

None.

## Known Issues

This extension is useful but somewhat limited. It does not enforce matching tag-names, identify the inappropriate use of ditto-tags, give the most specific classification of keys/selectors when they are quoted, recognise iterated escape sequences such as &\&\&\n. Nor does it include any features that are scheduled for JinXML v2 or v3.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
